# Information 

The FM transmitter is a single transistor circuit. In the telecommunication, the frequency modulation (FM) transfers the information by varying the frequency of the carrier wave according to the message signal. 
Generally, the FM transmitter uses VHF radio frequencies of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz to transmit & receive the FM signal.
This transmitter accomplishes the most excellent range with less power.
The performance and working of the wireless audio transmitter circuit depend on the induction coil & variable capacitor

# Methodology

The formation of the oscillating tank circuit can be done through the transistor by using the inductor and variable capacitor. The transistor used in this circuit is an NPN transistor used for general purpose amplification. If the current is passed at the inductor L1 and variable capacitor then the tank circuit will oscillate at the resonant carrier frequency of the FM modulation. The negative feedback will be the capacitor C2 to the oscillating tank circuit.

To generate the radio frequency carrier waves the FM transmitter circuit requires an oscillator. The tank circuit is derived from the LC circuit to store the energy for oscillations. The input audio signal from the mic penetrated to the base of the transistor, which modulates the LC tank circuit carrier frequency in FM format. The variable capacitor is used to change the resonant frequency for fine modification to the FM frequency band. The modulated signal from the antenna is radiated as radio waves at the FM frequency band.

# Explaination of Circuit :

A tank circuit is formed by using transistor, variable capacitor and inductor . 
A audio signal from mic penetrate the base of the transistor and enters the tank circuit.
Current passes at inductor L1 and Variable capacitor oacilates the tank circuit and produces carrier waveform . 
C1 produces negative feedback.

Audio signal enters the tank circuit and modulates the carrier frequency in FM formate. 
Variable capacitor is used to change the resonant frequency for modification of FM band.
Modulated signal from antenna is transmitted as a radio waves within the frequency band of 88 to 108 MHz. 

# Applications :

The FM transmitters are used in the homes like sound systems in halls to fill the sound with the audio source.

These are also used in cars and fitness centers.

The correctional facilities have used in the FM transmitters to reduce the prison noise in common areas.
