# Introduction - 

The FM transmitter is a single transistor circuit. 

In the telecommunication, the frequency modulation (FM) transfers the information by varying the frequency of the carrier wave according to the message signal. 

Generally, the FM transmitter uses VHF radio frequencies of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz to transmit & receive the FM signal. 

This transmitter accomplishes the most excellent range with less power. 

The performance and working of the wireless audio transmitter circuit depend on the induction coil & variable capacitor.
